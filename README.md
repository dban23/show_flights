# Show Flights

The idea behind this is to make an app that will find your current location and use that location to find live flights around you. So when you open it, you can see which flight is currently in the sky above you. I got the idea from [TheFlightWall](https://theflightwall.com/).

Currently written in python but might switch to some other language. 

If you want to use this code, you will need to create your API key here: [AeroAPI](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/), and then save it to your .env file as "FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY".

We'll see how it will turn out in the end.
